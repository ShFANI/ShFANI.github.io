#  Work Experience

Here are some highlights from my career:

**Biostatistician / Dat Scientist** - **BC Centre for Disease Control** *, 2022-2024.*  
- Led design and implementation of predictive models and advanced statistical analysis to forecast syphilis trends in BC and informing evidence-based decision-making for provincial programs.
- Built and maintained data pipelines and analytic datasets by integrating surveillance, clinical, and administrative data using SQL and R.
- Established analysis plans and produced validated tables, listings, and figures (TLFs) for internal reviews and public-health reporting; ensured traceability and reproducibility with R and version control at GitHub.
- Developed interactive Power BI / R Shiny dashboards that provided real-time insights into key performance indicators for leadership and program managers.
- Supported clinical collaborators in study design, sample size estimation, and statistical analysis plans, ensuring high-quality methodological approaches.
- Collaborated with epidemiologists, clinicians, and the program leaders to define metrics and evaluation frameworks that supported monitoring, reporting, and continuous quality improvement.
- Produced clear presentation reports and visual summaries translating complex analytics for non-technical audiences and multidisciplinary teams.

**Teaching & Consulting Roles (Sessional / Contract – Statistics and Data Science)** - **University Canada West** *, 2023-2025.*
  - Designed and taught graduate-level courses in business analytics and machine learning, emphasizing real-world data applications and hands-on problem-solving with Python using Databricks for data preparation and scalable analytics workflows, and Power BI and R Shiny to build clear, stakeholder-ready dashboards and interactive visualizations.
  - Guided students through individual and team-based projects, case studies, and assessments to develop data-driven thinking and actionable business insights.
 - Provided methodological consulting for students and faculty, including study design, modelling strategies, and interpretation of results.

**Research Associate and Lecturer** - **The University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus** *, 2021-2022.* 
  - Developed advanced statistical models to analyze British Columbia wildfire patterns, resulting in two peer-reviewed publications contributed to understanding of environmental risk factors and prediction accuracy.
  - Designed and supervised individual and group-based capstone projects, to strengthen students' capabilities in statistical reasoning and modeling in real-world data application such as using deep learning (CNN) model to classify brain tumor types from medical imaging data, semantic model to detect scam calls using sentence transformer embeddings and a Logistic Regression/XGBoost classifier.
  - Summarized key patterns in dashboards and reports to support learner assessment, program evaluation, and continuous quality improvement.

**Postdoctoral Fellow and Lecturer** - **University of Calgary** *, 2018-2021.*
  - Developed novel nonparametric estimation methods for hazard and survival functions under additive hazard models, tailored for interval-censored, right-censored, and mixed-type survival data, with applications to larynx cancer and kidney transplant studies.
  - Taught undergraduate and graduate courses in mathematics and statistics, including Probability Theory, Survival Analysis, Regression Modeling, and Statistical Inference, with a focus on applied examples and hands-on data analysis.

**Assistant Professor** - **Allameh Tabatabei University** *, 2015-2018.*
- Taught graduate and undergraduate courses in statistics department such as Probability and Statistics I, Probability and Statistics for Engineering, Statistical Inference, Probability Theory, and Statistical Methods, Sampling Methods 1 and 2.
- Advisor to the Students’ Scientific Association for Statistics, leading academic enrichment activities and
organizing monthly departmental seminars to promote collaborative learning and research engagement.
- Conducted program evaluation and accreditation within the Department of Statistics, compiling program metrics and evidence to support departmental accreditation and quality improvement.

**PhD Student** - **The University of Auckland** *, 2010-2015.*
- Conducted advanced statistical research on nonparametric estimation of baseline hazard and prognostic factors using proportional hazards models, applied to kidney transplant data, larynx cancer data, and human mortality dataset, providing robust survival analysis insights in medical contexts.
- Led a population health research project analyzing mortality trends in New Zealand, comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, with a focus on identifying health disparities and informing equity-driven health policy.
  
**Data Scientist and Researcher** - **Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases** *, 2007-2008*
- Designed a retrospective cohort using hospital cancer registry and EMR data; defined inclusion/exclusion,
baseline, and follow-up windows; primary endpoints: overall survival and disease-free survival.
- Used SQL to extract, join, and transform relational registry/EMR tables into analysis-ready datasets; built reproducible data pipelines and validation checks (duplicates, missingness, consistency).
- Managed data quality: variable harmonization, outcome verification, missing-data handling (multiple imputation), etc.
- Addressed confounding and case-mix differences; ran sensitivity analyses for model robustness.
- Generated parametric survival fits (e.g., Weibull/log-logistic) for a model comparison with proportional hazard models.
- Delivered stakeholder-ready reporting through Power BI dashboards (key cohort characteristics, outcomes, and trends) and an interactive R Shiny app for exploratory analysis and stratified survival visualization.
