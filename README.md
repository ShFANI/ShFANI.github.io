## üíº Work Experience

Here are some highlights from my career:

**Biostatistician** - **BC Centre for Disease Control** *, 2022-2024.*  
  -	Identified a rising trend in syphilis incidence over a 15-year period using time-series analysis, informing public health policy and targeted intervention strategies.
  -	Applied advanced statistical models to uncover geographic and demographic patterns in syphilis prevalence, supporting the development of region-specific prevention programs.
  -	Developed predictive models to forecast future trends in syphilis based on historical epidemiological data, enhancing planning and resource allocation for healthcare systems.

**Research Associate and Lecturer** - **The University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus** *, 2021-2022.* 
  - Developed advanced statistical models to analyze British Columbia wildfire patterns, resulting in two peer-reviewed publications that contributed to improved understanding of environmental risk factors and prediction accuracy.
 - Designed and evaluated applied learning projects, including individual and group-based capstone assignments, to strengthen students' capabilities in statistical reasoning, data modeling, and real-world data application.
  - Mentored and supervised capstone students, guiding end-to-end project development in areas such as predictive modeling, simulation, and data-driven decision-making.

**Postdoctoral Fellow and Lecturer** - **University of Calgary** *, 2018-2021*
  - Developed advanced statistical models to analyze British Columbia wildfire patterns, resulting in two peer-reviewed publications that contributed to improved understanding of environmental risk factors and prediction accuracy.
  -	Designed and evaluated applied learning projects, including individual and group-based capstone assignments, to strengthen students' capabilities in statistical reasoning, data modeling, and real-world data application.
